# Welcome to Impulse Interactive!

Impulse Interactive is a collective of indie developers with a passion for great games. We started our game dev journey in September 2023, submitting small games for [FailJam](https://itch.io/jam/failjam) and Github's [GameOff 2023](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2023). We've just started working on our first longer term project that we plan on publishing next year, called Project Beholder. Keep an eye on the website for updates :)

Fun fact, we're also good friends who have been gaming together for over 10 years, since childhood! Some of our most played titles are Minecraft, CS:GO, Factorio, VALORANT, and HELLDIVERS! But we all venture off and play singleplayer titles like Resident Evil, Hades, CrossCode, and Death Stranding.
